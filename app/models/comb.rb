  # We can map Combs to WorkerBees using a "has_many, through" relationship. 
  # Combs can be mapped to WorkerBees through PollenGlobs, Nectars, or 
  # Advisements. In this case, we have chosen PollenGlobs. Mapping through 
  # Nectars and Advisments as well is unnecessary, as the relationship will only 
  # return duplicates. Additionally, we use the "distinct" method to remove any 
  # duplicates of the  "Comb -> PollenGlob -> WorkerBee" relationship.
